13. View the applications by appending /wear and /watch to the URL you opened in the previous step.

14. You are requested to change the URLs at which the applications are made available.

Make the video application available at /stream.
- Ingress: ingress-wear-watch
- Path: /stream
- Backend Service: video-service
- Backend Service Port: 8080

```shell
k edit ingress ingress-wear-watch -n app-space

17. Due to increased demand, your business decides to take on a new venture. You acquired a food delivery company. Their applications have been migrated over to your cluster.

Inspect the new deployments in the app-space namespace.

```shell
k get svc -n app-space
NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
default-backend-service   ClusterIP   10.98.164.161   <none>        80/TCP     10m
food-service              ClusterIP   10.109.50.90    <none>        8080/TCP   17s
video-service             ClusterIP   10.102.21.62    <none>        8080/TCP   10m
wear-service              ClusterIP   10.96.61.112    <none>        8080/TCP   10m
```

18. You are requested to add a new path to your ingress to make the food delivery application available to your customers.


Make the new application available at /eat.

- Ingress: ingress-wear-watch
- Path: /eat
- Backend Service: food-service
- Backend Service Port: 8080

```shell
k edit ingress ingress-wear-watch -n app-space
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ingress-wear-watch edited
```
```yaml
      - backend:
          service:
            name: food-service
            port:
              number: 8080
        path: /eat
        pathType: Prefix
```

19. View the Food delivery application using the /eat URL in your browser.

Click on the Ingress tab above your terminal, if its not open already, and append /eat to the URL in the browser.

20. A new payment service has been introduced. Since it is critical, the new application is deployed in its own namespace.

Identify the namespace in which the new application is deployed.

```shell
k get svc -A
NAMESPACE        NAME                                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
critical-space   pay-service                          ClusterIP   10.108.254.139   <none>        8282/TCP                     17s
```

21. What is the name of the deployment of the new application?

webapp-pay

```shell
k get deploy -n critical-space
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
webapp-pay   1/1     1            1           74s
```

22. You are requested to make the new application available at /pay.

Identify and implement the best approach to making this application available on the ingress controller and test to make sure its working. Look into annotations: rewrite-target as well.

- Ingress Created
- Path: /pay
- Configure correct backend service
- Configure correct backend port

```shell
k create ingress -h | less

controlplane ~ âœ– kubectl create ingress ingress-pay-service -n critical-space --rule="/pay=pay-service:8282"
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ingress-pay-service created
````

23. View the Payment application using the /pay URL in your browser.

Click on the Ingress tab above your terminal, if its not open already, and append /pay to the URL in the browser.
